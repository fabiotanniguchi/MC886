\section{Introduction}

The motivation behind this assignment is to reinforce the contents studied in class about Linear Regression and the basics of Machine Learning.
The task at hand is to find a Linear Regression based model to predict the release year of songs ranging from 1922 to 2011.

\section{Activities}
 
The state-of-the-art research (about prior work for solving the same problem).

\section{Proposed Solutions}

The proposed solutions for the selected problem.

\section{Experiments and Discussion}

The experiments carried out and the obtained
results.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

The main conclusions of the work as well as some future directions for other people interested in continuing this work.
